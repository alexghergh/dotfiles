Dotfiles for daily use ðŸ“š

Using GNU Stow as a symlink solution, since it's much easier for everyone
involved.

To use this, simply install stow and then run the install script:
`sh install`.

However, make sure that none of the directories/config files exist before
running this, otherwise stow will refuse to overwrite the files.
